// limit to one 3 fortunes per day - click tracking
// localStorage - you can save stuff in a window for later 
// store when were the last clicks made date and time

// after 3 clicks on the page, any button pressed should display an angry popup
    //I'm an octopus, not a fortune factory!
// offer octupus fun facts second time use tries to surpass fortune limit
//finding an API for fortunes or octupus facts - don't use anything with an API Key yet
// ideal to use something that exists rather than make it

// a "DO NOT TOUCH ME THERE" button
//issues are figuiring out where the suction pads are

// mouseover animations - last priority
// should be pretty striaghtforward - regular octopus to angry
// key frames - can be used for shaking or something
// "no returns or refunds!!" // "I cannot guarantee results"

//do you have any questions. comments, or concerns for this ocutopus
//can event listeners trigger audio? download audio file and put it in assets and then research
